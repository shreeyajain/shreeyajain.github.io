	abstract={While some real-world factory tasks can be completely automated using robots, many still require human expertise and involvement for robot control. However, traditional robot operation requires that users undergo extensive and time-consuming robot-specific training to understand the specific constraints of each robot. In this work, we reimagine how a user can assign and monitor remote assembly tasks in Virtual Reality (VR) through high-level goal-based instructions rather than low-level direct control. We are developing a testbed in which a motion-planning algorithm determines, verifies, and executes the robot-specific trajectories in simulation. We highlight design considerations and potential benefits of this approach.},

	abstract={We introduce a practical robotics solution for the task of heterogeneous bagging, requiring the placement of multiple rigid and deformable objects into a deformable bag. This is a difficult task as it features complex interactions between multiple highly deformable objects under limited observability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robotic system consisting of two learned policies: a rearrangement policy that learns to place multiple rigid objects and fold deformable objects in order to achieve desirable pre-bagging conditions, and a lifting policy to infer suitable grasp points for bi-manual bag lifting. We evaluate these learned policies on a real-world three-arm robot platform that achieves a 70% heterogeneous bagging success rate with novel objects. To facilitate future research and comparison, we also develop a novel heterogeneous bagging simulation benchmark that will be made publicly available.},
