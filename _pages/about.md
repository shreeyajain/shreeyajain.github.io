Hi there! I am a second year Master's student studying Computer Science at Columbia University. I work as a research assistant, advised by <a href='https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~shurans/'>Professor Shuran Song</a> at the <a href='https://cair.cs.columbia.edu/'>Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab</a>. I also actively collaborate with <a href='http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/'>Professor Steven Feiner</a> at the <a href='https://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home'> Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab</a>.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics. I am broadly interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent systems to learn from their interactions with the physical world and subsequently, acquire novel & complex skills that can effectively assist humans. 

Before joining Columbia, I obtained my integrated B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Economics from <a href='https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/'>Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani</a>. 
<!-- For my final year undergraduate thesis, I interned at the <a href='http://ivilab.org/index.html'>Interdisciplinary Visual Intelligence Lab (IVILAB), University of Arizona</a>, under the guidance of <a href='https://adarsh.cc/'>Dr. Adarsh Pyarelal</a> and <a href='http://kobus.ca/'>Professor Kobus Barnard</a>. -->
