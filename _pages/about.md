Hi there! I am a Robotics Software Engineer at <a href='http://graymatter-robotics.com/'>GrayMatter Robotics</a>, where I help develop smart, easy to use, and rapidly deployable robots for high-mix manufacturing operations. Prior to joining GMR, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University and an integrated B.E. in Computer Science with M.Sc. in Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. At Columbia, I worked as a research assistant advised by <a href='https://shurans.github.io/'>Professor Shuran Song</a> [Professor Shuran Song]() at the <a href='https://cair.cs.columbia.edu/'>Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab</a>. I also actively collaborated with <a href='http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/'>Professor Steven Feiner</a> at the <a href='https://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home'> Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics. I am broadly interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent systems to learn from their interactions with the physical world and subsequently, acquire novel & complex skills that can effectively assist humans.

You can reach out to me at shreeya@graymatter-robotics.com, I am always happy to chat!

<!-- For my final year undergraduate thesis, I interned at the <a href='http://ivilab.org/index.html'>Interdisciplinary Visual Intelligence Lab (IVILAB), University of Arizona</a>, under the guidance of <a href='https://adarsh.cc/'>Dr. Adarsh Pyarelal</a> and <a href='http://kobus.ca/'>Professor Kobus Barnard</a>. -->
